Folder code contains C++ code and files required for the germinal centre (GC) simulations.

Folder scripts contains R scripts used for the analysis of simulation results.



Steps to run the GC simulations and analyze the results

-> Specific settings need to be activated in cellthis.cpp and hyphasma.cpp (code -> src) for certain simulations. 
These lines are marked with <GClifetime paper> along with the description


-> Two command line arguments need to be provided for running the simulations

1) Name of the parameter file in Parameters folder
2) Name of the 2nd parameter file (Number of GCs and initiation times) in Par2files folder


-> Result files of individual simulation repeats need to be collected in folders named 000, 001, ..., 00X

-> To analyze the results, copy the R script and .txt files <from scripts folder> to the main folder containing the result folders (000, 001, ...), and run the script Plotall.R

-> figures will be generated in a new folder called results
